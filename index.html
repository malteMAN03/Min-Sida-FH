                            Forza Horizon is an open world racing game for Xbox and PC. The game has increadeble graphics <br/>
                            and deatail in both landscape and cars. In all of the games there are big variations in different <br/>
                            events and stuff to do. There is currently 4 games in the series but because it is so pupular <br/>
                            and the latest game had 2 milion players in the first weak. This means that a fith game will <br/>
                            probobly be released in the not so distant future.

                    Forza Horizon is what happens when you assemble a crack team of talented racing game veterans, plucked <br/>
                    from a bunch of the UK’s finest driving developers, and shove them all under one roof and set them loose <br/>
                    with Microsoft’s money.This supergroup of racing devs is called Playground Games and its staff hail from <br/>
                    some of the UK’s best and brightest racing studios; Codemasters, Bizarre, Criterion and many more. Playground <br/>
                    Games' job was to take the incredible resources of the Forza franchise and create an open-world spin-off <br/>
                    of this generation's leading circuit racer.The results speak for themselves. Forza Horizon is the open-world <br/>
                    racing game that open-world racing game fans have always wanted.Think Test Drive Unlimited but with the <br/>
                    nuanced handling and carefully crafted cars of the Forza franchise mixed with the confident presentation <br/>
                    fans of Codemasters' racers are accustomed to.

            <h2>Forza Horizon 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Forza Horizon 2 rebottles the winning formula established by its predecessor, albeit with a heaped <br/>
                    tablespoon of new and improved ingredients. The eclectic roster of 200+ lavishly detailed cars here ranges <br/>
                    from cult coupes to hypercars, and it’s the best line-up in the open-world racing business. Like Horizon <br/>
                    before it, they all feel distinct from one another too, thanks to the Forza series’ familiar, top-quality <br/>
                    driving dynamics. As usual, supercars feel crisp and sharp, SUVs feel suitably soggy, and everything seems <br/>
                    honed to let you heave your cars into corners with two glorious fistfuls of opposite lock. The backdrop <br/>
                    this time is a slab of land straddling the border of northern Italy and the south of France. It’s <br/>
                    wish-fulfilment for Forza fans who’ve spent the last decade watching the hosts of Top Gear cocking about <br/>
                    on the Mediterranean coastline every second week.

                <p>
                    The term we use in Australia for what Americans call doing doughnuts is “circle work.” Right now I’m doing <br/>
                    some spectacular circle work around an outback airstrip in a custom V8 ute with all the trimmings. I’m talking <br/>
                    high-powered spotlights, a CB antenna sticking proudly up into the air, and a giant, mesh-filled roo bar that <br/>
                    looks like it’s fallen off the front of a Kenworth. ‘Thunderstruck’ is banging on my stereo and the tacho <br/>
                    needle is banging on the redline. This is Forza Horizon 3 for me; an experience that could only get more <br/>
                    Australian if it was delivered inside a giant jar of Vegemite by Paul Hogan crashing into your living room riding <br/>
                    an actual crocodile. But maybe that’s not your bag. You may prefer classic American muscle, or perhaps you’re <br/>
                    more partial to Japanese tuners from the turn of the century, or maybe you haven’t got time for anything but <br/>
                    European hypercars. That’s okay too, because the Forza franchise is famous for its wonderfully eclectic approach <br/>
                    to car curation and Forza Horizon 3 is no exception; it’s still the best in the business.

            <h2>Forza Horizon 4</h2>
                <p>
                    Forza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it <br/>
                    into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive <br/>
                    array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the <br/>
                    Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return <br/>
                    thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards. Every real-time <br/>
                    week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific <br/>
                    challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, <br/>
                    online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip <br/>
                    away at a shared goal.
